# Bonfire of the Vegetables

This repository contains the code, images, and words for my cooking recipes website.

If published at all, the site should be available at: [feargoidte.github.io/bonfire-of-the-vegetables/](https://feargoidte.github.io/bonfire-of-the-vegetables/).

Partials for the website come from my [Cloch Fiacail](https://github.com/FearGoidte/cloch-fiacail) project which is a rather ramshackle assemblage of general stylesheet rules. They are currently added as [symlinks](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man7/symlink.7.html) rather than a [submodule](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules) to make local testing easier.

## Nuts & bolts

The website is currently generated by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com).
